# üìß Email Invoice Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## üéØ What Was Built

### **Email Invoice with PDF Attachment**

The email feature now:
1. ‚úÖ Generates a PDF of the invoice
2. ‚úÖ Attaches it to an email client message
3. ‚úÖ Pre-fills recipient, subject, and body
4. ‚úÖ Works across different platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux)

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### **User Flow:**
1. User clicks **"Email"** button on invoice detail page
2. System generates PDF from current invoice
3. **On macOS**: Opens Mail.app with PDF already attached
4. **On Windows/Linux**: Opens default email client with pre-filled message and shows PDF in file explorer for manual attachment

### **Technical Flow:**

```
User clicks "Email"
    ‚Üì
Frontend generates PDF using jsPDF + html2canvas
    ‚Üì
PDF converted to base64
    ‚Üì
Electron IPC call: 'email-invoice'
    ‚Üì
Backend saves PDF to temp folder
    ‚Üì
[Platform-specific email opening]
    ‚Üì
Success toast notification
```
