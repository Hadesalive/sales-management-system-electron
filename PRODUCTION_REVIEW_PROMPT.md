---

## Application Overview

### **Type**: Electron Desktop Application (Local-only, no server)
### **Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Desktop**: Electron 22
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Charts**: Chart.js
- **Build**: electron-builder

### **Core Features**:
1. **Inventory Management** - Products, stock tracking, categories
2. **Customer Management** - Profiles, store credit, purchase history
3. **Sales Management** - POS system, walk-in customers, receipt printing
4. **Invoice Management** - Multiple templates, payment tracking
5. **Orders Management** - Purchase orders, supplier tracking, stock addition
6. **Returns Management** - Product returns, refunds, stock restoration
7. **Financial Dashboard** - Revenue, profit, trends (return-adjusted)
8. **Settings** - Company settings, preferences, data backup/import

---

## Key Technical Decisions to Review

### **1. Architecture**
- **IPC Communication**: All backend communication via Electron IPC (no API routes)
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation between UI and IPC handlers
- **Database Service**: Central database operations with field mapping
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Zod schemas

**Question**: Is this architecture solid for a desktop app? Any anti-patterns?

### **2. Database Design**
- **8 Tables**: customers, products, sales, invoices, orders, returns, invoice_templates, company_settings
- **Foreign Keys**: Enforced relationships with ON DELETE SET NULL
- **JSON Fields**: Items stored as JSON strings in TEXT columns
- **Field Mapping**: camelCase (JS) ↔ snake_case (SQL) conversion
- **Transactions**: Used for multi-step operations
- **Triggers**: Auto-update timestamps

**Questions**:
- Is storing items as JSON acceptable or should we normalize?
- Are the foreign key relationships correct?
- Any potential data integrity issues?
- Is field mapping being done consistently?

### **3. Stock Management**
- **Sales**: Auto-deduct stock with validation to prevent overselling
- **Orders**: Auto-add stock when status = "delivered"
- **Returns**: Auto-restore stock when status = "approved/completed"
- **Deletion**: Smart reversal of stock changes

**Questions**:
- Are there race conditions in stock updates?
- Is validation comprehensive enough?
- Any edge cases we're missing?

### **4. Revenue Calculations**
- **No Double-Counting**: Sales with linked invoices only counted once
- **Return Adjustments**: Only cash/original_payment refunds reduce revenue
- **Store Credit**: Treated as liability, not revenue loss
- **Time-Based**: Returns impact the month they occurred

**Questions**:
- Is the revenue logic financially accurate?
- Any edge cases in the calculations?
- Are monthly/weekly profit trends correct?

### **5. Store Credit System**
- **Auto-Addition**: Returns with refundMethod='store_credit' add to customer balance
- **Application**: Can apply credit to invoices and sales
- **Tracking**: Visible in customer details

**Questions**:
- Are there any credit manipulation vulnerabilities?
- Is the credit system properly audited?
- Any potential for credit duplication?

### **6. Data Persistence**
- **Development**: Database in project root
- **Production**: Database in user data directory (OS-specific)
- **Export/Import**: Full data backup to JSON
- **Onboarding**: First-run wizard for new users

**Questions**:
- Is the environment detection reliable?
- Will production builds truly start clean?
- Is export/import comprehensive?
- Any data loss scenarios?

- Are troubleshooting guides adequate?

---

## Specific Code Patterns to Review

### **1. Field Mapping (camelCase ↔ snake_case)**
Check `electron/services/database-service.js`:
```javascript
const fieldMapping = {
  'customerId': 'customer_id',
  'customerName': 'customer_name',
  // etc.
};
```
**Is this being applied consistently everywhere?**

### **2. Stock Validation**
Check `electron/handlers/sales-handlers.js`:
```javascript
// Before sale creation
if (currentStock < quantitySold) {
  return { success: false, error: 'Insufficient stock' };
}
```
**Are there race conditions? Is validation comprehensive?**

### **3. Return Impact on Revenue**
Check `src/app/dashboard.tsx`:
```javascript
const revenueReducingReturns = returnsData.filter(
  ret => (ret.status === 'completed' || 'approved') &&
         (ret.refundMethod === 'cash' || 'original_payment')
);
```
**Is this logic correct? Any edge cases?**

### **4. IPC Error Handling**
Check all `electron/handlers/*.js`:
```javascript
try {
  const result = await databaseService.someMethod();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}
```
**Is error handling sufficient? Are errors properly logged?**
